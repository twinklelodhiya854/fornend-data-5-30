What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements
inHTML? Provide examples of each.

<!-- block level -->

 These elements always start on a new line and take up the full available width of their parent container. The "block" other elements from appearing next to them horizontally

 <p> 
<h1> to <h6> 
<div> 
<ul>, <ol>, <li>
<form>


<!-- inline elements -->

These elements do not start on a new line and only take  as much width as their content requires. They flow within the text content, allowing other inline elements to appear on the same line.

<span> 
<a> 
<strong> or <b> 
    
<img> 
<input>
